After finishing my practice for the day, I write here what I expect to learn tomorrow. In my learning journey, deciding where to go next has been the most difficult thing for me. I always get stucked wondering how to keep improving.

Day 6
- Complete a few more Exercism problems (2 or 3) [DONE]

 SOME IDEAS:
  - Python script that returns the weather, gets info from web service
  - Python script that draws depending on how long a user presses certain keys. Changes colours and then returns a picture (blind_painting.py), something like that
